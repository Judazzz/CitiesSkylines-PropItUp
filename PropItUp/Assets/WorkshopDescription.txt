[h1]About this mod[/h1]
[quote]Prop it Up! is a mod with a number of features that allow you to access and replace props and trees that are free-standing and embedded in buildings - in real-time. These features can be divided in global and asset-based tools.[/quote]

[h1]So, how do I use this mod[/h1]
[quote]All features of this mod can be accessed through its panel. To toggle the panel, you can use one of the three available key combinations: by default this is Alt-P, but in the mod options panel you can change this to Ctrl-P or Shift-P. Your prefered key combination will be stored in the mod's config file.
The second way to toggle the panel is by clicking on the button with the tree icon: by default this button is located in the lower right corner, near the Free Camera button, but you can place it anywhere you want by dragging it while keeping the right mouse button clicked. Its position will be stored in the mod's config file.

When you open the mod panel, you will find three tabs: [b]Global[/b], [b]Asset props[/b], and [b]Asset trees[/b].

[b]Global[/b]: in this panel you can replace free-standing and embedded vanilla trees with different ones on a [i]global, city-wide level[/i]. This feature is useful when you quickly want to replace all trees that do not fit the theme of your city: for example to replace all palm trees with pine or oak trees when you are playing on a temperate or boreal map. It can also be useful as a work-around for the - as-of-yet still unresolved - problem of flickering trees caused by the Random Tree Rotation mod.
To use this feature, select a tree from the top list, select a replacement from the bottom list (use the search box above the replacement list to quickly find the tree you are looking for), and click the [b]Replace tree[/b] button to apply the change. Vanilla trees that have a global replacement applied to them are indicated in the list with a *, and to see what replacement tree you have used, hover the cursor over the vanilla tree item in the list. To undo a replacement, select the tree you want to reset in the top list and click the [b]Reset tree[/b] button (it will only be available when you have selected a replaced tree in the list).
Note: if you switch from the [b]Building props[/b] or [b]Building trees[/b] panel, the currently selected building be unselected.
Note: the global replacements you make apply to every instance of the selected tree on your map, as well as any newly added ones for as long as your global replacements remain active.

[b]Asset props[/b]: in this panel you can replace props on a [i]per-building basis[/i]. This feature is useful when you want to replace building props that you don't like or that just don't fit. For example: I have always been bugged by the unrealistic amounts of table sets on roof tops that certain buildings have, and this mod allows me to replace them with more fitting props like antennas or chimneys.
To use this feature, first select the building that you want to edit: the building selection tool will open as soon as you open this panel. Once a building is selected, the building's name will be displayed at the top of the panel, and all the building's props will be shown in the top list. To replace a prop, select it in the top list, then select a replacement from the bottom list (use the search feature above the replacement list to quickly find the prop you are looking for), and click the [b]Replace prop[/b] button to apply the change. After a replacement the name of the replaced prop will be replaced with the name of the replacement prop, so you will always see what props are currently being used by that building. To undo a replacement, select the prop you want to reset in the top list and click the [b]Reset prop[/b] button (it will only be available when you have selected a replacement prop in the list).
Note: right-click to de-select the currently selected building (the building name will disappear from the panel's top).
Note: if you switch from the [b]Building trees[/b] panel, the currently selected building will remain selected.
Note: the replacement(s) you make will apply to every instance of that building present in your city, as well as every instance that you add later.

[b]Asset trees[/b]: in this panel you can do the same as in the Asset Props panel, but obviously instead of props it will let you replace trees on a per-building level.[/quote]

[h1]Notes (really, read this)[/h1]
[quote]I have tried to make this mod as flexible and robust as possible, but there are a few things you'll need to keep in mind when using this mod:
- this mod can only replace props and trees that are present in-game: this means that dependencies that you have not subscribed to are out of reach of this mod;
- certain props have special properties, such as seating area's (benches) or are decal props: these props can only be replaced by props with those same properties. This is the reason why sometimes you will find just a few replacement options;
- unless you know what you are doing, it is not recommended to replace two or more different props or trees with the same replacement. The reason for this can best be illustrated with an example: imagine a building containing two trees (A and B), and you replace both those trees with tree C. From that moment on, the mod forgets that the building used to contain 2 separate trees, and will one detect tree C. All further replacements will apply to every tree in that building;
 - to get the most out of this mod, I highly recommend players apply all desired global tree replacements first, and add per-building replacements afterwards. The reason for this is that when a city is being loaded, per-building replacements are applied first, and global replacements afterwards;
- due to the realtime application of replacements, per-building and global replacements can override each other;
- this mod only affects free-standing trees and props and trees embedded within buildings. If you want to customize roadside trees, use Boformer's awesome [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543722850]Network Skins[/url] mod;
- as of version 1.6, Cities: Skylines' Asset Editor supports prop randomization: I have not specifically tested this mod with that feature, but I don't expect any unusual behavior;
- the above list of limits and peculiarities are the result of either the way the game itself works, or design choices made by me. By subscribing to this mod, you acknowledge you have read and are familiar with the above list, and accept that mod support is not applicable to these issues.[/quote]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[quote]This mod should be compatible with all other mods.
I have not done compatibility tests for every mod available in the Workshop for obvious reasons, but I have not found any incompatibilities between this mod and the ones I am subscribed to.[/quote]

[h1]Wish List (not to be confused with to-do list)[/h1]
[quote]- replacing a prop or tree with nothing ('soft removal');
- adding support for currently unlisted props (like solar panels, decal props, markers);
- adding support for props/trees hotloaded with Tailgunner's awesome [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=793489846]Aedificium[/url] mod;
- config files per save game or city;
- per-building replacements on instance level instead of asset level: this would allow players to customize each and every building in their cities individually.[/quote]
