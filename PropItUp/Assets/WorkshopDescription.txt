[h1]About this mod[/h1]
[quote]Prop it Up! is a mod with a number of features that allow you to access and replace props and trees that are free-standing and embedded in buildings - in real-time. These features can be divided in global and asset-based tools.[/quote]

[h1]So, how do I use this mod[/h1]
[quote]See '[url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/878991312/133259227529823319/]How to use Prop it Up![/url]'[/quote]

[h1]Notes (really, read this)[/h1]
[quote]I have tried to make this mod as flexible and robust as possible, but there are a few things you'll need to keep in mind when using this mod:
- this mod can only replace props and trees that are present in-game: this means that dependencies that you have not subscribed to are out of reach of this mod;
- certain props have special properties, such as seating area's (benches) or are decal props: these props can only be replaced by props with those same properties. This is the reason why sometimes you will find just a few replacement options;
- the Extreme Mode option gives the player unrestricted access to every prop and tree installed, including markers and effects. [b]Extreme Mode is still experimental and therefore unsupported: use is strictly at your own risk!!![/b];
- unless you know what you are doing, it is not recommended to replace two or more different props or trees with the same replacement. The reason for this can best be illustrated with an example: imagine a building containing two trees (A and B), and you replace both those trees with tree C. From that moment on, the mod forgets that the building used to contain 2 separate trees, and will one detect tree C. All further replacements will apply to every tree in that building;
 - to get the most out of this mod, I highly recommend players apply all desired global tree replacements first, and add per-building replacements afterwards. The reason for this is that when a city is being loaded, per-building replacements are applied first, and global replacements afterwards;
- due to the realtime application of replacements, per-building and global replacements can override each other;
- this mod only affects free-standing trees and props and trees embedded within buildings. If you want to customize roadside trees, use Boformer's awesome [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543722850]Network Skins[/url] mod;
- as of version 1.6, Cities: Skylines' Asset Editor supports prop randomization: I have not specifically tested this mod with that feature, but I don't expect any unusual behavior;
- the above list of limits and peculiarities are the result of either the way the game itself works, or design choices made by me. By subscribing to this mod, you acknowledge you have read and are familiar with the above list, and accept that mod support is not applicable to these issues.[/quote]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[quote]This mod should be compatible with all other mods.
I have not done compatibility tests for every mod available in the Workshop for obvious reasons, but I have not found any incompatibilities between this mod and the ones I am subscribed to.[/quote]

[h1]Wish List (not to be confused with to-do list)[/h1]
[quote]- replacing a prop or tree with nothing ('soft removal');
- config files per save game or city;
- per-building replacements on instance level instead of asset level: this would allow players to customize each and every building in their cities individually.[/quote]
